# InFocus
Implementation of our phase profile design technique in Nitin Jonathan Myers, Robert W. Heath Jr., "InFocus: A spatial coding technique to mitigate misfocus in near field LoS beamforming," accepted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, August 2021

The beams in a near field communication scenario can focus RF signals in a spatial region called the focal point. 
The focal point, however, changes with the frequency of operation in a wideband phased array that uses a center 
frequency-based beamformer. This efect called misfocus, reduces the efective operating bandwidth of the near field system. 
To mitigate the misfocus effect, we propose a technique called InFocus that constructs beams which are well suited for massive wideband phased arrays. 
InFocus enables massive wideband phased array-based radios to achieve a higher data rate than comparable beamforming solutions.
